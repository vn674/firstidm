<h2> Brunch </h2>
<h3> Canh Su Su Nau Tom Bam </h3>
<p> I had a light cough, so I ate chayote soup that I made the day before. It was my first time making this soup and it reminded me of home. </p>

<h3> Bread and Pico de Gallo </h3>
<p> I was still hungry after eating soup, so I made bread with pesto and pico de gallo on top. </p>
